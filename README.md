# Secure Note

Secure Note is a simple, fast, and secure way to share self-destructing notes. Create a note, set its expiration, and share the link. The note's content is encrypted and can only be accessed with the unique link.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Notes are encrypted in your browser before being sent to the server. They can only be decrypted with the unique key in the URL fragment, which is never sent to the server.
- **Self-Destruction**: Notes can be set to expire after a certain amount of time or after being viewed a specific number of times.
- **Password Protection**: Add an extra layer of security with an optional password.
- **Markdown Support**: Format your notes using Markdown.
- **QR Code Sharing**: Easily share the note link using a generated QR code.
